def spaces_and_tabs():
    '''
    A few of you lost all their marks in A1 because their file 
    contained syntax errors such as:
      + Missing ':' at the end of 'if' or 'for' statements.
      + A mix of tabs and spaces to indent code. Remember that indendation is part
        of Python's syntax. Mixing tabs and spaces is not good because it
        makes indentation levels ambiguous. For this reason, files 
        containing a mix of tabs and spaces are invalid in Python 3. This
        file uses *spaces* for indentation: don't add tabs to it!
    Remember that you are strongly encouraged to check the outcome of the tests
    by running pytest on your computer and by checking Travis.
    Task: Nothing to implement in this function, that's a bonus point, yay!
